# Lab 01 Report

In this lab, I learned the basics of Git and GitHub.  
I practiced creating files, adding content, and pushing changes to a remote repository.  
I also learned how to create and delete files, and how Git tracks these changes.  
Working with branches was new to me, and I understood how to create a branch, make changes, and then merge it back to the main branch.  
Overall, this lab helped me understand the importance of version control and how it makes teamwork easier.
